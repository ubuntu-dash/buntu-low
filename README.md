Buntu, a simple OS built on GNOME focusing on lightweightness. Only includes a basic HTTPS/HTTP HTML5 browser, terminal, apt, and anything you want to add aswell.
<br>
## Features

APT, a simple package downloader present in most Linux Distros.
<br>
BunBrowse, a simple, lightweight internet browser than supports FTP, HTTPS, and also has built-in dangerous website blocker. Addons are different than anything else.
<br>
Terminal, what more to explain? BuntuTerm? No, its a poorly skinned Bash copy.
<br>
apt-get, For beginners, just use APT to save your life. APT-GET is just a *fancy* thing
<br>

## Update Branches + Download Sources

<br>
This is a simple OS. You can only download this from the official BuntuLow repository.
<br>
There MIGHT be a release on Sourceforge and a VM/USB release. For now, we stick with the iw-av-mkb-azn branch. IW-AV-MKB-AZN IS NOT A RANDOM CAT DANCE. Official branches will be posted on Repos on the UbuntuDash profile. IW-AV-MKB-AZN, IA-BG-HXS-PQS, 00-32-345-093, are the current branches.
<br>
Github is the only download canditate you can get BUNTU from.
<br>
BuntuLow is a low-end version to the Buntu series. BuntuMedium, BuntuHi, and BuntuMax, alongside BuntuSERV will be released after BuntuLow's first month of development.
<br>
The studio is not ready yet for BuntuLow, check the Wiki for a headsup on the download process with the Dev Pre-Alpha Unready canditate program.
